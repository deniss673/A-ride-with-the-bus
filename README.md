 # 🚌 A Ride with the Bus

*A Ride with the Bus* is a stylized 3D Unity game that turns the mundane journey of a student commuting from dorm to university into a fun, chaotic experience. With procedurally generated cities and unpredictable NPCs, every ride is a new story.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Play as a student trying to catch the bus in a dynamic, ever-changing city.
- Explore procedurally generated roads and buildings based on splines.
- Interact with NPCs powered by AI Behavior Trees — some friendly, some not.
- Fight, dodge, or sneak your way through unexpected obstacles on the way to class.
- The bus waits — but not forever.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Unity** (URP) + **C#**
- **NavMesh & AI Behavior Trees** for NPC movement
- **Procedural generation** using spline-based city layout
- **Custom combat system** with animated combos
- **Mixamo** for rigged characters and animations

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deniss673/A-ride-with-the-bus.git
2. Open in Unity 6.0 or later.
3. Select Scenes/Test to fight the npc
4. Select Scenes/Testing to create the map

## 🚧 Roadmap
- Smarter NPC interactions (stealing, talking, avoiding)
- Random events and obstacles
